One sentence from Abstract: In this work, we depart from these traditional approaches with complicated feature engineering by introducing a convolu- tional neural network for relation extraction that automatically learns features from sen- tences and minimizes the dependence on ex- ternal toolkits and resources. Our model takes advantages of multiple window sizes for fil- ters and pre-trained word embeddings as an initializer on a non-static architecture to im- prove the performance. We emphasize the re- lation extraction problem with an unbalanced corpus.
